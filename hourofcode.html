  <h3>The hour of code</h3>
  <p>Our Hour of Code event took place on October 31, 2023, at Narimanov 200 No High School. We had a total of four motivated 
    students participating in the event. The event was held in Azerbaijani, making it accessible to all. Our team was well-prepared 
    and organized according to the guidelines provided at hourofcode.com. Nigar Gurbanova took the lead in coordinating and 
    planning the event, while each team member had specific responsibilities. We successfully coordinated our event with 
    200 No. High School, ensuring that there were no scheduling conflicts. The school recommended that we can arrange lesson for 
    8th-grade classes. Zahra Asgarova used her communication and persuasion skills to take a class for our Hour of Code event, 
    so we were able to motivate 26 students for this work and they voluntarily participated in that event. We used our email account 
    from ADA University to register our event on the Hour of Code website. Laman Jananova served as a tutor, leading the students 
    through the Classic Maze puzzle from Code.org. Support from other team members made sure that everyone could keep up and help 
    the students. We started the class with a short introduction about ADA University, providing context for the students. 
    Sevinc Guluyeva documented the event with 10-15 action-packed photos and videos that captured the participants' enthusiasm and 
    the learning process. Our Hour of Code event was a great success, introducing four students to the world of coding and programming. 
    We are proud of each team member's efforts and grateful to 200 No. High School for hosting our event. We look forward to upcoming 
    chances to support coding education in our community. </p>
